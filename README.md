# Medical Image Classification for Disease Diagnosis Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Summary

The project titled **"Medical Image Classification for Disease Diagnosis Using Convolutional Neural Networks"** aims to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for the automatic classification of medical images. Specifically, the project focuses on the classification of X-ray images for normal, pneumonia, and tuberculosis cases, as well as CT and MRI scans for the detection of brain tumors.

The project utilizes state-of-the-art technologies and techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to process and analyze medical images. The CNN models are trained on a diverse and extensive dataset of X-ray, CT, and MRI images, ensuring a wide range of cases and high accuracy in disease detection.

## Background

Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Radiological imaging techniques, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans, provide valuable insights into the internal structures of the human body, aiding healthcare professionals in identifying abnormalities and making informed decisions. However, the manual interpretation of medical images by radiologists is a time-consuming and often subjective process. There is a growing need for automated systems that can assist in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of medical conditions.

To address this need, the project leverages the power of machine learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the analysis of medical images. CNNs are highly effective in image recognition tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations.

## Problem Statement

Developing an accurate and reliable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for the multi-class classification of medical images, enabling the rapid and precise diagnosis of normal, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and brain tumor cases. The project seeks to streamline the medical image analysis process, reduce radiologists' workload, and enhance patient care, all while addressing ethical and privacy considerations.
